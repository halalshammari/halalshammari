## Hi there 👋
# Hala Alshammari
I am a Computer Science student specializing in Artificial Intelligence, and this is a space where I learn out loud.
Every project here is an intentional effort to become great, and I am determined to have an impactful presence, one repo at a time.
I’m not here to showcase perfection, I’m here to document growth.  
You’ll find experiments, learning milestones, and projects that reflect where I am and where I’m headed.
