# Welcome!

## I am **Hala Alshammari** — thank you for stopping by 🪷

I am a Computer Science student specializing in Artificial Intelligence, and this is a space where I learn out loud.

Every project here is an intentional effort to become great, and I’m determined to have an impactful presence — one repo at a time.

You’ll find experiments, learning milestones, and projects that reflect where I am and where I’m headed.

> Here’s to every line of code that brings me closer. 💻🦾👩🏻‍💻
